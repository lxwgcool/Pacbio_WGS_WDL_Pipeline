## Files related to phasing info (e.g. HiPhase)
4 Types of files below
1. Phase block file
2. Chromosome Summary File
3. Haplotag file
4. Algorithm Statistics File
```
1: Phase block file (--blocks-file)
This CSV/TSV file contains information about the the phase blocks that were output by HiPhase.

2: Chromosome Summary File (--summary-file)
This CSV/TSV file contains chromosome-level summary statistics for all phase blocks on that
chromosome. Additionally, a chromosome labeled "all" contains aggregate statistics for all phase
blocks generated by HiPhase.

3: Haplotag file (--haplotag-file)
This CSV/TSV file contains haplotag information for aligned reads. Note that while this
contains the same information as the HP tag in the haplotagged output BAMs, generating those
output BAMs is not required to generate this file.

4: Algorithm Statistics File (--stats-file)
This CSV/TSV file contains statistics regarding the performance of the underlying algorithms
while running HiPhase. This file is primarily for developers looking to improve HiPhase,
but may be of use while identifying problematic phase blocks. For details on how these
relate to the internal algorithms, refer to our methods.

## Example
### Phase block file

Notice:
1. The meaning of each section
```
source_block_index - The index of the phase problem within HiPhase.
                     These values are 0-based and monotonically increasing.
                     Duplicates can appear if an initial phase block was split while
                     solving the phase problem (e.g. see block #10 in the example). Blocks
                     indices may be skipped if singleton blocks are not enabled.
sample_name - the sample name for the block, mostly for multi-sample inputs
phase_block_id - The phase block ID, which should match PS tags in both the VCF and BAM outputs
chrom - the chromosome the block is on
start - the position (POS) of the first variant in the block, 1-based
end - the position (POS) of the last variant in the block, 1-based
num_variants - the total number of phased variants in the phase block
```
2. How to understand "Start" and "End"
   * It is **NOT** the starting and ending position of each block
   * It is the position of the **first** and the **last** variant inside block 
   * The "start = end" means that there is only 1 variant in this block
