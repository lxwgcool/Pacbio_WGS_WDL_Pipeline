## Carcinoma Model
1. Having identified ten dominant multicellular ecosystems (CE)

## The cellular, genomic, and clinical characteristics of CEs
1. Eight CEs were significantly prognostic in univariable models
2. Five remained significant after multivariable adjustments for stage, age, and sex
3. Ref: Check (Figure 5A; Table S6).

## The Explanation from CE1 to CE10
### CE1, CE2
1. high tumors were lymphocyte deficient
2. strongly linked to higher risk of death
3. broadly distinguished by elevated levels of POSTN+ fibroblasts and basal-like epithelial cells, respectively
4. Ref: Check (Figures 4B and 5A)

### CE3
1. high tumors
   * predictive of worse survival outcome
   * were myeloid enriched
   * microsatellite instability (MSI) high
2. associated with COSMIC mutational process 17
   * a signature found in multiple tumor types including esophageal and gastric cancers
     * where it has been linked, at least in part, to gastric reflux.
3. Ref: Check Table S6.

### CE4
1. high tumors
   * were associated with myogenesis and males over 60 years of age
     * in part owing to their higher prevalence in HNSCC and prostate cancer

### CE5, CE6, CE7, CE8
1. high tumors were enriched for
      * smoking-related mutations
      * normal tissue
      * age-related mutations
      * moderately favorable outcomes

### CE9, CE10
1. high tumors were proinflammatory (i.e., leukocyte rich)
2. strongly associated with longer overall survival
3. characterized by higher immunoreactivity, including
   * IFN-Î³ signaling
   * higher B cell content

## Notification
### CE4, CE10
Two CEs were present at similar frequencies in tumor and adjacent normal tissues but depleted in
healthy tissues, reflecting a potential field effect.

### CE6
with the exception of CE6, were largely specific to neoplastic tissue (Figure 5B).

Characteristics of carcinoma ecotypes in the discovery cohort. Top: CE-specific survival associations across 16 carcinomas, colored by favorable (blue) or
adverse (red) survival (color scale identical to Figure S4A). Center: CIBERSORTx-inferred proportions of 12 major cell types (averaged and scaled), grouped by
the most abundant CE per tumor. Bottom: Key features of each CE. Enrichment statistics were calculated by dividing tumors into classes for which the indicated
CE is highest (Table S6).
