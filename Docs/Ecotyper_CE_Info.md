## Carcinoma Model
1. Having identified ten dominant multicellular ecosystems (CE)

## The cellular, genomic, and clinical characteristics of CEs
1. Eight CEs were significantly prognostic in univariable models
2. Five remained significant after multivariable adjustments for stage, age, and sex

### CE1 and CE2
1. high tumors were lymphocyte deficient
2. strongly linked to higher risk of death
3. broadly distinguished by elevated levels of POSTN+ fibroblasts and basal-like epithelial cells, respectively

### CE3

## Reference
1. CE1 and CE2

Characteristics of carcinoma ecotypes in the discovery cohort. Top: CE-specific survival associations across 16 carcinomas, colored by favorable (blue) or
adverse (red) survival (color scale identical to Figure S4A). Center: CIBERSORTx-inferred proportions of 12 major cell types (averaged and scaled), grouped by
the most abundant CE per tumor. Bottom: Key features of each CE. Enrichment statistics were calculated by dividing tumors into classes for which the indicated
CE is highest (Table S6).
